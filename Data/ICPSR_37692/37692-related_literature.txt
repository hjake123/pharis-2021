About 21 percent of all state and federal prisoners reported that they had
possessed or carried a firearm when they committed the offense for which
they were in prison. Thirteen percent of all prisoners had used a firearm
in their offense by showing, pointing, or discharging it during the offense
for which they were imprisoned. Less then 2 percent of all prisoners had
obtained a firearm from a retail source and possessed, carried, or used it
during their offense. Among the estimated 287,400 prisoners who had
possessed a firearm during their offenses, 56 percent had either stolen it
(6 percent), found it at the scene of the crime (7 percent), or obtained it
off the street or from the underground market (43 percent). Most of the
remainder (25 percent) had obtained it from a family member or friend; 7
percent had purchased it under their own name from a licensed firearm
dealer. About one in five prisoners who possessed a firearm during their
offense obtained it with the intent of using it during the crime. Handguns
were the most common type of firearm. Among state prisoners who possessed a
gun during their offense, 27 percent killed someone with it; another 12
percent injured someone; 7 percent fired the gun but did not injure anyone;
and 54 percent did not fire it. State prisoners with no military service
were more likely to possess a gun during their offenses (21 percent) than
prisoners who had served in the military (16 percent). 15 tables and 1

This Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) report presents detailed
statistical tables on mortality in state and federal prisons. It provides
information on cause of death; decedent characteristics, such as age,
gender, and race or ethnicity; and mortality rates of inmate populations,
compared to the general U.S. adult population. The report is based on BJS’s
annual Mortality in Correctional Institutions data collection, which
obtains information on persons who died while in the physical custody of
state departments of corrections.

The SPI provides national statistics on prisoner characteristics across a
variety of domains, such as current offense and sentence, incident
characteristics, firearm possession and sources, criminal history,
demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, family background, drug and
alcohol use and treatment, mental and physical health and treatment, and
facility programs and rules violations. The SPI can also be used to track
changes in these characteristics over time, describe special populations of
prisoners, and identify policy-relevant changes in the state and federal
prison populations. From January through October 2016, data were collected
through face-to-face interviews with prisoners, using computer-assisted
personal interviewing (CAPI). In a CAPI interview, interviewers read
questions aloud and enter responses directly into a laptop computer,
allowing skip patterns and other routing criteria to be implemented
automatically. SPI interviews averaged approximately 50 minutes, including
about 2 minutes for the consent process and 48 minutes to complete the
survey. Interviews were conducted in English (94 percent;) and Spanish (6
percent). This report describes the SPI’s universe, sample design and
selection, selection of prisoners, sample size and response rate, consent,
analysis for non-response bias, and weighting and non-response adjustments.
