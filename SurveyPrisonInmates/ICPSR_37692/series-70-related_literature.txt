Prisoners in 1997 reports the number of persons in State and Federal
prisons at yearend, compares the increase in the prison population during
1997 with that of the previous year, and gives the 5- and 10-year growth
rates. This annual Bulletin reports the number of male and female
prisoners, the incarceration rates for States, and data on prison
capacities and use of local jails because of prison crowding. Highlights
include the following: During 1997 the number of female prisoners rose by
6.2%, slightly greater than the increase in male prisoners (5.2%). At
yearend 1997, 79,624 women were in State or Federal prisons -- 6.4% of all
prison inmates. On December 31, 1997, State prisons were operating at
between 15% and 24% above capacity, while Federal prisons were operating at
19% above capacity. California (157,547), Texas (140,729), and the Federal
system (112,973) together held 1 in every 3 prisoners in the Nation.
Fifteen States, each holding fewer than 5,000 inmates, together held only
4% of the Nation's prisoners.

The variables used to compare statistics include regional variations,
gender, age, ethnicity, and offense type. On any given day, there are up to
100,000 juveniles in custody; of the 11,000 different facilities that might
hold juveniles, only 30 percent are specifically designed for youthful
offenders, while the remainder are adult jails, police lockups, and State
correctional institutions. The findings reported here show that the highest
rate of juveniles in custody is in the Western U.S., while the South has
the highest rate of juveniles in adult facilities. One-day counts of youths
in juvenile facilities indicate that minority youths have higher rates of
confinement than whites, and males higher rates than females. Females are
more likely to be confined for status offenses and as non- offenders.
Between 1977 and 1987, declining juvenile admissions to public facilities
were counterbalanced by a large increase in admissions to private juvenile
correctional facilities; the data also suggest that length of stay
increased during that period. Currently available data provide little
insight into key policy questions regarding length of confinement,
recidivism rates, and costs of various juvenile correctional alternatives.
The report examines data collected through national juvenile court
statistics and the National Survey of Youth in Custody. It recommends
upgrading national data on youths in custody by improving sampling
strategies, data collection techniques, and future data analysis
procedures. 16 tables, 6 figures, and 2 appendixes
